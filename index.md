##### The plant propagation algorithm is a crossoverless population based evolutionary algorithm, in which fitter individuals produce more offspring with smaller mutations, and unfitter individuals produce fewer offspring with larger mutations in an effort to balance the forces of exploration and exploitation. It is relatively successful on continuous benchmark test functions, finding hard NP-complete problem instances and image approximation in computational art. We know relatively much about its parameter tuning and control, have some insight in multiobjective optimization and Pareto-fronts, and have a number of variations and practical applications in areas such as scheduling and chemical engineering. This mini zoomposium is to facilitate the dissemination of earlier published work, work-in-progress and staging ideas, as well as staying connected as a community.

#### 13:00 Eric Fraga (UCL) - Ranking solutions for fitness in PPA Multi-Objective optimization <img align="right" width="100" src="Eric.jpg">  

##### The PPA uses fitness as the key driver for propagation.  For single objective optimization problems, a simple and effective fitness ranking can be based on the objective function value.  For multi-objective optimization, ranking the solutions in a population is more complex.  This talk presents 3 alternatives and illustrates their impact on a simple problem of the design of the operating schedule for a batch reactor.

#### 13:25 Quinten van der Post - A scheduling app using the PPA-algorithm <img align="right" width="100" src="Quinten2.jpg">  

##### One HillClimbing algorithm and two implementations of the Plant Propagation Algorithm (PPA-1 and PPA-2) are applied to an instance of the University Course Timetabling Problem from the University of Amsterdam. After completing 10 runs of 200,000 function evaluations each, results show that PPA-1 outperforms the HillClimber, but PPA-2 makes the best timetables. With a live demonstration.

#### 14:10 Nielis Brouwer (UvA) Survivor Selection in a Crossoverless Evolutionary Algorithm <img align="right" width="100" src="Nielis.jpg">  

##### By default PPA deploys plus-selection as survivor selection method â€“ selecting the best popSize individuals from the combined parent and offspring populations. We will explore 7 alternative survivor selection methods (comma selection, tournament selection with and without replacement, elitist tournament selection, linear ranking, and (elitist) roulette wheel selection) on 59 continuous benchmark function instances and discuss the results

##### A first set of experiments conducted by Levi Koppenhol show that PPA has parameter sensitivity on the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem. However, it also shows to be unsensitive to instance specifics.

#### 15:20 Danny Dijkzeul (UvA, Cover Genius) - Painting with Evolutionary Algorithms <img align="right" width="100" src="Danny.jpg">  

##### A fixed number of brush strokes images are initialized on a canvas, their position, size, rotation, colour, stroke type and draw- ing index all randomly chosen. These attributes are then modi ed by stochastic hillClimbing, simulated annealing or the plant propagation algorithm, approximating a target image ever closer. This talk discusses the results

#### 15:45 Dante Niewenhuis (UvA) - Genetic programming: making hard benchmark functions <img align="right" width="100" src="Dante.jpg">

##### Benchmark functions are important for performance comparison of optimization algorithms. In this work-in-progress, we attempt to create hard benchmark functions for the Plant Propagation Algorithm with genetic progamming. We will present some preliminary progress, and discuss the challenge of finding a suitable measure of 'hardness' for the evolving benchmark functions.
