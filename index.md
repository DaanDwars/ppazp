# Program (in CEST time zone)

#### 13:00 Daan van den Berg (UvA, VU, Yamasan) - PPA & TSP: a troubled marriage

A first set of experiments conducted by Levi Koppenhol show that PPA has parameter sensitivity on the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem. However, it also shows to be unsensitive to instance specifics.


#### 13:20 Nielis Brouwer (University of Amsterdam)

#### 13:40 Eric Fraga (University College London) - Ranking solutions for fitness in PPA Multi-Objective optimization

The PPA uses fitness as the key driver for propagation.  For single objective optimization problems, a simple and effective fitness ranking can be based on the objective function value.  For multi-objective optimization, ranking the solutions in a population is more complex.  This talk presents 3 alternatives and illustrates their impact on a simple problem of the design of the operating schedule for a batch reactor.


#### 14:00 break (@home)

Everybody makes their own coffee.


#### 14:30 Danny Dijkzeul (UvA, Cover Genius)
